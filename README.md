# vector-intrinsics
Vivek contains x86 vector functions that use intrinsics.
Civek contains counterparts to Vivek functions written in C++ without intrinsics.
Stub and Timer comprise a benchmarking suite. Executing stub.cpp will perform 100 tests, the output of which will be dumped to a csv file.

"Vivek" and "Civek" are working names intended to invoke Almsivi Restoration, although they are mainly the result of "Vivek" sounding kind of like "vector".
