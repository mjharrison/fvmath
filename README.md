# fvmath

<h3>fvmath</h3>

fvmath.hpp and fvmath.cpp provide x86 functions that use Intel Intrinsics to perform packed vector operations.

<h3>vmath</h3>

vmath.hpp and vmath.cpp provide identical functions to fvmath but without Intel Intrinsics to enable direct performance comparisons.

<h3>testing</h3>

test.hpp, timer.hpp, test.hpp, and test.cpp comprise a simple benchmarking tool. Note that the entry point for this project exists in test.cpp.
