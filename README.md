# fvmath
fvmath provides x86 functions that use Intel Intrinsics to perform packed vector operations.

stub and timer comprise a benchmarking suite. The preset benchmarking test will perform 100 tests and then write the results of those tests to a csv file. The tests directly compare fvmath and vmath, the latter of which provides an identical set of functions to fvmath but without the use of Intel Intrinsics.
