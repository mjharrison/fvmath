# vector-intrinsics
Vivek contains x86 vector functions that use intrinsics. Civek contains counterparts to Vivek functions written in C++ without intrinsics. These are working names intended to invoke Almsivi Restoration, although they were mainly selected because "Vivek" sounds similar to "vector".

Stub and Timer comprise a benchmarking suite. Executing stub.cpp will perform 100 tests and then write the results of those tests to a csv file.
